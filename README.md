This repository contains examples and information about C programming.

## Why C programming is awesome

C programming is awesome because it allows for low-level manipulation, efficient memory management, and direct access to hardware. It is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and developing high-performance applications.

## Inventor of C

C programming language was invented by Dennis Ritchie.

## Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds

Dennis Ritchie is the creator of the C programming language. Brian Kernighan is a co-author of the book "The C Programming Language" and made significant contributions to the development and popularization of C. Linus Torvalds is the creator of the Linux operating system, which is primarily implemented in C.

## Compilation with gcc

When you type `gcc main.c`, the `gcc` command invokes the GNU Compiler Collection to compile the `main.c` file. It performs several stages, including preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking, to generate an executable file.

## Entry Point and Main

In C programming, the entry point is the starting point of a program's execution. The `main` function serves as the entry point in C programs. It is where the execution of the program begins.

## Printing Text

To print text in C, you can use various functions:
- `printf`: Allows you to format and print text to the standard output.
- `puts`: Prints a string to the standard output, followed by a newline character.
- `putchar`: Prints a single character to the standard output.

## Getting Size of a Type

You can use the `sizeof` operator to determine the size of a specific type in bytes. For example, `sizeof(int)` returns the size of an integer in bytes.

## Compiling with gcc

To compile a C program using gcc, you can use the following command:
