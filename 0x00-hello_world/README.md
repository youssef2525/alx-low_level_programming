This repository contains solutions for various low-level programming tasks.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Preprocessor

**Description:**
Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.

**Instructions:**
1. Set the C file name in the `$CFILE` variable.
2. Run the script `0-preprocessor`.
3. The output will be saved in the file `c`.

### Task 1: Compiler

**Description:**
Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.

**Instructions:**
1. Set the C file name in the `$CFILE` variable.
2. Run the script `1-compiler`.
3. The output file will be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c`.

### Task 2: Assembler

**Description:**
Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.

**Instructions:**
1. Set the C file name in the `$CFILE` variable.
2. Run the script `2-assembler`.
3. The output file will be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`.

### Task 3: Name

**Description:**
Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.

**Instructions:**
1. Set the C file name in the `$CFILE` variable.
